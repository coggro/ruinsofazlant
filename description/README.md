Saarideh catches eyes wherever she goes, but especially on the deck of a ship manned by more common races. Sure, she's average height and build and has sometimes been spotted wearing a light (but opaque) cloak of hunter green below deck, but it's difficult to distract from her rather uncommon garb -- or her blue skin, finned ears, and webbed digits. 

Her outfit is painstakingly put together and well-cared for; a relatively tight-fitting set of normal clothing constructed of slick-looking fabrics and skins. The whites and blues of the cloth bits have gotten dimmed and muddied, but she is otherwise well-put together and presentable. A scimitar hangs on her belt, and two shortspears sit in a quiver slung diagonally across her lower back while one rests in her hand.

As the spray from the sea slaps into her, she doesn't blink -- she looks straight out into the path of the ship, almost as though she expects to spot something. Below deck, when she's left alone or sitting by herself, she sometimes pulls out a rod of wood that looks slightly off, until you realize that it still looks to be alive and has a rigid thistle growing out of its base.

She accomplishes her duties fastidiously, and often with a bit of flair. For instance, when she prepares dry rations for the crew, she folds the wrapping parchment in such a way that the bread is still dry when unwrapped -- a difficult feat on a ship. She is hesitant to teach others, but delights when they pick the technique up swiftly and is easily annoyed when others take longer.

At night, she asks to go review star charts with the navigator, and they quiz each other on constellations.

## Things Saarideh Says:

"Tide and tomb..." -- An exasperated curse

"Nothing is lost to the depths." (occasionally extended: "...If it cannot be found/returned, that's where it was meant to be from the start.") -- When things seem irredeemable or to be going poorly, as an assurance that this is how things were meant to go.
